## Vim Mode Next [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bronson/vim-mode-next.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bronson/vim-mode-next)

Inspired by the [linux-next branch](https://lwn.net/Articles/289013/), vim-mode-next is
an integration area for mostly-finished [vim-mode pull requests](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/pulls).


## Installing

First, disable vim-mode and restart Atom.  vim-mode and vim-mode-next are, unsurprisingly, incompatible.

Then, install vim-mode-next as you would any other Atom package.

## Interesting Packages

Consider installing these packages to provide even more Vim finger-feel:

* [ex-mode](https://atom.io/packages/ex-mode) to provide the start of a working command line.
* [cursor-history](https://atom.io/packages/cursor-history) implements ctrl-i/ctrl-o navigation.
* [vim-surround](https://atom.io/packages/vim-surround) starts implementing
  [tpope's plugin](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround).
* [open-this](https://atom.io/packages/open-this) may have some functionality that
  [#727](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/pull/727) doesn't.


## Interesting Ideas

Why restrict your vim-mode experience to the text buffer?

* [#686](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/pull/686) add vertical/horizontal split key bindings to tree-view
* [#745](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/pull/745) Make `j` and `k` navigate the fuzzy finder and search results


#### vim-mode-next Branches

The [ready branch](https://github.com/bronson/vim-mode-next/commits/ready)
is where the action is.  It contains the the raw pull requests and
conflict resolutions.

The [master branch](https://github.com/bronson/vim-mode-next/commits/master)
includes the latest ready branch plus additional commits specific to vim-mode-next
(like this README).  Unlike every other git repository out there,
the master branch is completely uninteresting.
